keys.cfg is the config file used for the custom key hooks in bandtest.dll 2.1.
keys.cfg must go into the data folder.
Each line in the file looks like this
Jetpack=Y_Key
The part before the = is the logical key name and is what is used by a script to refer to the key.
The part after the = is the physical key name and refers to the actual keyboard key tat you press to trigger the particular logical key.
All the scripts (and other features) that use particular logical keys will specify in the documentation which keys they are listening for.
To edit keys.cfg you can use the GUI app I wrote (see keycfg.txt for details)
Or you can edit manually.
