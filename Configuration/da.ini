[General]

; GameMode
;
;  This setting determines what game mode the server will run. Each game mode has its own settings file, named the same as the game mode, in which you
;  can define the various da.ini settings to overload them while that game mode is running. This settings file also holds the game mode's data, such as
;  node or flag positions, or score limits.
;
;  Valid game modes are:
;
;  AOW - All Out War: Allows AOW specific settings to be loaded from da_aow.ini.
;  Marathon - Marathon: Allows Marathon specific settings to be loaded from da_marathon.ini.
;  Infantry - Infantry: Implemented through disable list settings in da_infantry.ini.
;  Sniping - Snipers: Implemented through disable list settings in da_sniping.ini.
;  Domination - Domination: Settings and data loaded from da_domination.ini.
;  CTF - Capture the Flag: Not yet implemented. Included if you're running your own version and want the game mode messages to be correct. da_ctf.ini.
;  Deathmatch - Deathmatch: Not yet implemented. Included if you're running your own version and want the game mode messages to be correct. da_deathmatch.ini.
;  CoOp - Co-Operative: Not implemented. Included if you're running your own version and want the game mode messages to be correct. da_coop.ini.
;
;  There are three different ways to use the GameMode setting:
;  1. Random. Simply setting the game mode to "Random" will randomly choose one of the above game modes each map.
;  2. Single. Set the game mode to one of the above. If a map does not support the selected game mode then it defaults to AOW.
;  3. Multiple. Multiple|game modes|can|be|used|like|this. One will be randomly selected each map. If none of the game modes support the map it defaults to AOW.

GameMode=AOW

; ShowGameModeTitle

;  001[<Time>] <Message> - Gamelog messages. Outputs information about ingame objects.
;  002[<Time>] <Message> - Renlog messages. Copy of everything written to the renlog file.
;  003<Message> - Console output. Copy of everything outputted to the console.
;  This setting is only loaded from da.ini general, and only on server startup.
;  Set the "Port" setting in ssgm.ini to the same value you use here. This is needed for older bots that were designed to work with SSGM and not DA.

; [Plugins]
;
;  Here you can list DA and SSGM plugins you want to load.
;  The plugin system allows users to write scripts.dll based plugins which are then loaded by DA. With this you can add features without having to
;  directly edit the DA source.
;  Plugins are only loaded from this file, and only once on server startup.
;  "<plugin name>.dll=1" - Load a plugin.

;  You can also create map specific versions of the custom sections in the format "[<Map>_<section>]". "[C&C_Field.mix_Disable_List]", for example.
